## Introduce

Winda is a minimalist World of Warcraft integration plugin, eliminating complex plugin settings in favor of providing players with a convenient interface for configuration. 

```
Remember: the key to using this plugin is simplicity!
```

## Co-creation
> <center>  Your first
> <center> Internet crowd-creation software project

To make it easier for people who can’t write code, I decided to launch a cloud-based Internet mass entrepreneurship project. You can also participate in the production of winda.

**"Winda Co-Creation"**

Winda Co-Creation is a large-scale online game——Open source project for World of Warcraft plug-ins. The purpose is to make an integrated plug-in similar to ElvUI.

We want to provide an easy-to-use, powerful, tool plug-in that can meet the needs of most players.

It's here!

### You come up with the needs

> FeiShu link：[https://kxxblqyumrm.feishu.cn/sheets/BeMjsw2JRhaLVIty2sCcwuVWnJf](https://kxxblqyumrm.feishu.cn/sheets/BeMjsw2JRhaLVIty2sCcwuVWnJf)   password：6Z75#899

In the demand stage, use cloud documents provided by Feishu. Submit your project requirements. You only need to target the current function. Suggest the plug-in capabilities you most want and need.

Each issue of Winda Co-Creation has a targeted functional module.

### Design together

> [https://www.figma.com/file/mDJJYea7WDsNhEVgAmkYk5/%E6%B8%A9%E8%BE%BE%E5%85%B1%E5%88%9B?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=oEQqV3BnnAmFvNkq-1](https://www.figma.com/file/mDJJYea7WDsNhEVgAmkYk5/%E6%B8%A9%E8%BE%BE%E5%85%B1%E5%88%9B?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=oEQqV3BnnAmFvNkq-1)

In the design stage, using Figma cloud design capabilities, design the interface in a targeted manner based on everyone’s needs.

You can use your design skills, to customize the interface and functions of winda.

We provide the concept of "skin" to switch between different styles of winda.

### Everyone decides the plan

> FeiShu link：[https://kxxblqyumrm.feishu.cn/docx/VWOTd6GaooSa1vxNyFpcpnw6nbg](https://kxxblqyumrm.feishu.cn/docx/VWOTd6GaooSa1vxNyFpcpnw6nbg)  password：1k65956#

When establishing the plan, we sorted out everyone’s needs and finally implemented them into a cloud document. This document is a project requirements document jointly established by combining requirements (Feishu) and design draft (figma).

You can use the comment function of the document to evaluate the requirements for each version .We will fully consider your proposal, until it is modified to the final version.

### I'll write the code

> [https://github.com/usiege/winda](https://github.com/usiege/winda)

The code and documents of the project will eventually be uploaded to the github code repository.

Of course, if you are a programmer, you can also move out the code through the winda public library and generate your own version.

After completing each small function, submit a Pull Request to me.I will check your code carefully and if it is fully functional it will become part of winda.

Your ability to contribute to open source projects will be greatly appreciated.

### Report the bugs

> FeiShu Link：[https://kxxblqyumrm.feishu.cn/sheets/I9NLsCaGVhHUL4tl6OBcCA61nJg](https://kxxblqyumrm.feishu.cn/sheets/I9NLsCaGVhHUL4tl6OBcCA61nJg)   password：d9732@31

Finally, this Winda co-creation project is a software project solely initiated by netizens and completed by netizens for use by netizens. The final use rights of the software belong to all game players. 

All bugs encountered during use can be submitted to developers through our Feishu documentation.

At the same time, we can also communicate and discuss directly with developers through the community.

Remember, here! The future of winda is decided by you!

## Document

This section describes the usage of each component of the plugin. The documentation will include updates on the plugin. The documentation should describe the details of the plugin in sufficient detail so that users can clearly understand each aspect.
